Run Length
Have the function RunLength(str) take the str parameter being passed and return a compressed version of the string using the Run-length encoding algorithm.
This algorithm works by taking the occurrence of each repeating character and outputting that number along with a single character of the repeating sequence. For
example: "wwwggopp" would return 3w2g1o2p. The string will not contain any numbers, punctuation, or symbols.
Examples
Input: "aabbcde"
Output: 2a2b1c1d1e
Input: "wwwbbbw"
Output: 3w3b1w
function RunLength(str) {
strarr = str.split("");
resarr = []; //a place to put my results as they are determined;
arrlen = strarr.length;
count = 1;
for (var i = 0; i <strarr.length; i++) {
if (strarr[i] == strarr[i+1]) {
count ++;
}
else {
var entry = count + strarr[i];
resarr.push(count + strarr[i]);
count = 1;
}
}
return resarr.join("");
}
