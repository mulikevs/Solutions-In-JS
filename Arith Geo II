Arith Geo II
Have the function ArithGeoII(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence follows an arithmetic pattern or
return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between
each of the numbers is consistent, where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or common ratio. Arithmetic example: [2,
4, 6, 8] and Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.
Examples
Input: [5,10,15]
Output: Arithmetic
Input: [2,4,16,24]
Output: -1
function ArithGeoII(arr) {
var len = arr.length;
//establish the relationship between two consecutive array elements
var mathConstant = arr[1] - arr[0];
var geoConstant = arr[1] / arr[0];
//test the array to see if the difference between elements is the same between
each pair of consecutive elements. If any pair fails, set flag to true and quit
for (var i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
if (arr[i + 1] - arr[i] !== mathConstant) {
var mathTest = true;
break;
}
}
//if the above loop went all the way through, then return answer "Arithmetic."
If not, then loop through the array testing each pair. If any pair fails, return -1
since it has failed both tests. If it makes it all the way, return 'Geometric.'
if (!mathTest) {
return 'Arithmetic';
}
else {
for (var j = 0; j < len - 1; j++) {
if (arr[j + 1] / arr[j] !== geoConstant) {
return -1;
}
}
return 'Geometric';
}
}
